# Spline Wrapper
[`react-map-gl`](https://github.com/visgl/react-map-gl) [`mapbox`](https://www.mapbox.com/)  

An unofficial plugin component for [react-map-gl](https://github.com/visgl/react-map-gl)

### Available functions
- Create curved lines (No more straight lines with sharp corners! üòâ)
- Add arrow to start/center/end of lines (Hopefully, this is helpful! ü•≥)

Here is a screenshot of the output after using both functions provided:

**Run this project to see the demo!** (Don't forget to add the token and map style first)

### Props
|Props|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|children| `Source` component|
|arrow| `{icon, position} object` where `icon` sets the **loaded** arrow image's name and <br> `position` can be set to either `start`,`center` or `end`|
|lines| `array` of `{from:[longitude, latitude], to:[longitude, latitude], properties:{}}`|

### Getting Started
#### Setup
- In your project directory, `npm install spline-wrapper` ([NPM package site](https://www.npmjs.com/package/spline-wrapper)) 

#### How to use SplineWrapper
- Import the component: `import SplineWrapper from "spline-wrapper"`
- Already have an existing Source and Layer components? Don't have them yet? Not an issue! üòâ  
```js
<Map>
  <SplineWrapper>
    //Copy&Paste or Create your Source and Layer components here
    <Source data={data}>
      <Layer/>
      ...
    </Source>
  </SplineWrapper>
</Map
```
- Want to add arrows? Just ensure you have loaded and added the icon ([Example: How to load & add an image üòÅ](https://github.com/A-amon/SplineWrapper/blob/2baf30b0fbd466a77060d669ec1774b67fd36040/src/App.js#L29)). Then, pass the icon's name to `icon` and set the `position`:  
```js
<SplineWrapper arrow={{
  icon:"arrow", // Pass the name of the loaded/added arrow image
  position:"start" // Can be either start, center or end
}}>
  ...
</SplineWrapper>
```
- Want curvy lines? Use `lines` props:  
```js
const lines = [
  {
    from:[51.5072, -0.1276],  // longitude, latitude
    to:[48.8566, 2.3522],     // longitude, latitude
    properties:{...}  // optional
  },
  {
    from:[48.8566, 2.3522],  // longitude, latitude
    to:[4.2105, 101.9758],     // longitude, latitude
    properties:{...}  // optional
  }
]
```
```js
<SplineWrapper lines={lines}>
  ...
</SplineWrapper>
```

### Notes üìù
- There is no `control points` prop (to control the curve level/intensity) available at the moment **but might be added if lots of people need it**
- Curves are only applied to lines generated from the `lines` prop
- Load and add icon image before passing the name to `arrow` prop
- The arrows are applied to every feature of type `LineString` (**including** those generated from `lines` prop)
- The arrow points to the direction of the line
- Since this is just a wrapper component, you should have almost full control over react-map-gl related uses
  
Enjoy this wrapper component!
