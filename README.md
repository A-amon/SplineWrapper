# Spline Wrapper
[`react-map-gl`](https://github.com/visgl/react-map-gl) [`mapbox`](https://www.mapbox.com/)  

An unofficial plugin component for [react-map-gl](https://github.com/visgl/react-map-gl)

### Available functions
- Create curved lines (No more straight lines with sharp corners! üòâ)
- Add arrow to end of lines (Hopefully, this is helpful! ü•≥)

Here is a screenshot of the output after using both functions provided:

**Run this project to see the demo!** (Don't forget to add the token and map style first)

### Props
|Props|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|children| `Source` component|
|hasArrow| **Required for arrow**<br>`boolean` value to add arrow to lines|
|iconImage| **Required for arrow**<br>`string` value for name of icon image to be used for arrow|
|lines| `array` of `{from:[longitude, latitude], to:[longitude, latitude], properties:{}}`|

### Setup
- In your project directory, `npm install react-map-gl mapbox-gl d3`
- Download [SplineWrapper](https://github.com/A-amon/SplineWrapper/tree/main/src/components/SplineWrapper) directory
- Import `SplineWrapper` component and use it! üòÅ


### Notes
- There are no `control points` prop (to control the curve level/intensity) available at the moment **but might add it if lots of people need it**
- Load and add icon image before passing the name to `iconImage` prop
- The arrow points to the direction of the line
- Since this is just a wrapper component, you should have almost full control over react-map-gl related uses
  
Enjoy this wrapper component!
